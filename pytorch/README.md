## Kernel activation functions (PyTorch)

In the *kafnets* module you can find the modules for defining KAFs and 2D-KAFs layers, both for feedforward networks and convolutional networks. The code has two demos to showcase the modules using the PyTorch sequential class.

## Requirements

The code has been tested with Python v3.6.1 and PyTorch v0.2.0.
